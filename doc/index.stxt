Title: STXT
+++++

We use STXT to write all of the docs for all of our projects. It allows us to
write docs that are readable in their source format as well as be quickly
generated for the Web and PDFs for print versions.

As a result, it’s grown to fit our needs, and we hope yours as well. You can
look inside any of our projects to find many uses of STXT, as well as examples
of the ant task.
